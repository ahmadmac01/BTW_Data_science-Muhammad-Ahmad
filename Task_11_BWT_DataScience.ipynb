        "## 8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?\n",

        "## 9. What is an online learning system?\n",
        "An online learning system is a machine learning model that learns incrementally, one instance at a time, allowing it to update its parameters continuously as new data arrives. This is useful for applications where data arrives in a stream and needs to be processed in real-time.\n",

        "## 10. What is out-of-core learning?\n",
        "Out-of-core learning refers to techniques used to train machine learning models on datasets that are too large to fit into a computer's main memory. These techniques load and process data in small chunks, allowing the model to learn from large datasets without requiring all data to be in memory at once.\n",

        "## 11. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?\n",
        "A Instance-based learning algorithm, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), relies on a similarity measure to make predictions by comparing new instances with instances from the training set.\n",

        "Model-based learning algorithms search for the optimal parameters that best fit the training data. The most common strategy is to minimize a loss function, such as Mean Squared Error for regression or cross-entropy for classification. They make predictions by applying the learned model parameters to new data.\n",

        "## 14. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?\n",
        "Insufficient Quantity of Training Data: Not having enough labeled data to train the model effectively.\n",

        "Poor Data Quality: Noisy, incomplete, or inconsistent data can lead to poor model performance.\n",
        "Overfitting: The model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
        "## 15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?\n",
        "This is likely due to overfitting. Possible solutions include\n",
        "* Regularization: Adding constraints to the model.\n",
        "* Simplifying the Model: Reducing the model's complexity.\n",
